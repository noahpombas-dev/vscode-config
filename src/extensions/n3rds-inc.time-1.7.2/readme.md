## Time

Track your coding time. Our solution offers functionality similar to CodeTime or WakaTime, except that it operates locally, and not based on a subscription.

### Key Features:

- **Local Operation**: Unlike other time tracking tools, all data is stored locally on your machine.
- **Accurate Time Tracking**: Monitor your coding sessions with precision across various projects and languages.
- **Performance Insights**: Gain valuable insights into your coding patterns and productivity without compromising your data.
- **Extended Capabilities**: 7-day tracking is free forever, extended tracking is available with a one-time purchase.

### Drawbacks:

- **Machine-Specific Tracking**: Due to its local nature, time tracking is limited to individual machines. If you use multiple devices for coding, each device will track time separately.
